Here are the vim syntax files for sjasm

Don't overlook the .vim sub-directory here!

If you want sjasm syntax highlighting in vim, link the .vim subdirectory
from here to your home directory with this:

ln -i -s $PWD/.vim/ $HOME/

or a similar command.  Important is that .vim from your $HOME points
to the .vim subdirectory here.

In order to fine-tune syntax with sjasm_syntax.vim
place this lines in your .vimrc:

"------------------

"------------------
" For Sjasm
source /home/niceno/sjasm_syntax.vim
